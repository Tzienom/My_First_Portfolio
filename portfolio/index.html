      <p>
        I am <strong>Gabriel</strong>, a devoted student of Software
        Engineering, presently crafting my foundation through the ALX Front-End
        Web Development programme. My pursuits lie at the intersection of logic
        and lyricism, where lines of code meet lines of verse.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I am software engineering student enrolled in ALX's Front-End Web
        Development programme, building a firm foundation in programming and the
        principles of technology. Though early in ny path, I am deeply drawn to
        the art of problem-solving and the elegance of turning abstract logic
        into working, tangible solutions. I have explored projects involving
        shell scripting and web interfaces.

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Beyond the screen, I am gospel pianist and poet&mdash;craftsman of both
        harmony and verse. I believe the discipline of music and the emotional
        depth of poetry serve to enrich my thinking as an engineer, allowing me
        to approach technology not just with intellect, but with intention and
        soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        In all things, I am committed to growth&mdash;striving not only to
        become a skilled software engineer, but a well-rounded creator whose
        work speaks with clarity, empathy, and excellence.
